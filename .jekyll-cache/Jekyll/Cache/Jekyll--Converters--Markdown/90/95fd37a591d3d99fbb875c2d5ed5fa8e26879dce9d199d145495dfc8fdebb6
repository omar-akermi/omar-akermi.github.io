<h1 id="task-2-installation">[Task 2] Installation</h1>

<p>We install Burp Suite.</p>

<h1 id="task-3-gettin-ca-certified">[Task 3] Gettin‚Äô [CA] Certified</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>Before we can start using our new installation (or preinstalled) Burp Suite, we‚Äôll have to fix a certificate warning. We need to install a CA certificate as BurpSuite acts as a proxy between your browser and sending it through the internet - It allows the BurpSuite Application to read and send on HTTPS data.</p>

</ul>

<h1 id="task-5-engage-dark-mode">[Task 5] Engage Dark Mode</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>With Burp Suite launched, let‚Äôs first navigate to the ‚ÄòUser options‚Äô tab. 
Next, click on the ‚ÄòDisplay‚Äô sub-tab.
Now, click on the ‚ÄòLook and feel‚Äô drop-down menu. Select ‚ÄòDarcula‚Äô.<br />
Finally, close and relaunch Burp Suite to have dark theme (or whichever theme you picked) take effect.</p>

<h1 id="task-6---proxy">[Task 6] - Proxy</h1>

<p><img src="/assets/img/thm/burp-suite/task-6.png" alt="Task 6" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>By default, the Burp Suite proxy listens on only one interface. What is it? Use the format of IP:PORT <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">127.0.0.1:8080</code></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Return to your web browser and navigate to the web application hosted on the VM we deployed just a bit ago. Note that the page appears to be continuously loading. Change back to Burp Suite, we now have a request that‚Äôs waiting in our intercept tab. Take a look at the actions, which shortcut allows us to forward the request to Repeater? <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CTRL-R</code></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How about if we wanted to forward our request to Intruder? <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CTRL-I</code></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Burp Suite saves the history of requests sent through the proxy along with their varying details. This can be especially useful when we need to have proof of our actions throughout a penetration test or we want to modify and resend a request we sent a while back. What is the name of the first section wherein general web requests (GET/POST) are saved? <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">HTTP history</code></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Defined in RFC 6455 as a low-latency communication protocol that doesn‚Äôt require HTTP encapsulation, what is the name of the second section of our saved history in Burp Suite? These are commonly used in collaborate application which require real-time updates (Google Docs is an excellent example here). <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">WebSockets history</code></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before we move onto exploring our target definition, let‚Äôs take a look at some of the advanced customization we can utilize in the Burp proxy. Move over to the Options section of the Proxy tab and scroll down to Intercept Client Requests. Here we can apply further fine-grained rules to define which requests we would like to intercept. Perhaps the most useful out of the default rules is our only AND rule. What is it‚Äôs match type? <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">URL</code></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How about it‚Äôs ‚ÄòRelationship‚Äô? In this situation, enabling this match rule can be incredibly useful following target definition as we can effectively leave intercept on permanently (unless we need to navigate without intercept) as it won‚Äôt disturb sites which are outside of our scope - something which is particularly nice if we need to Google something in the same browser. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Is in target scope</code></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h1 id="task-7---target-definition">[Task 7] - Target Definition</h1>

<p><img src="/assets/img/thm/burp-suite/task-7.png" alt="Task 7" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Browse around the rest of the application to build out our page structure in the target tab. Once you‚Äôve visited most of the pages of the site return to Burp Suite and expand the various levels of the application directory. What do we call this representation of the collective web application? <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">site map</code></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is the term for browsing the application as a normal user prior to examining it further? <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">happy path</code></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The issue definitions found here are how Burp Suite defines issues within reporting. While getting started, these issue definitions can be particularly helpful for understanding and categorizing various findings we might have. Which poisoning issue arises when an application behind a cache process input that is not included in the cache key? <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Web cache poisoning</code></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h1 id="task-8---puttin-it-on-repeater">[Task 8] - Puttin‚Äô it on Repeat[er]</h1>

<p><img src="/assets/img/thm/burp-suite/task-8.png" alt="Task 8" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Try logging in with invalid credentials. What error is generated when login fails? <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Invalid email or password</code></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now that we‚Äôve sent the request to Repeater, let‚Äôs try adjusting the request such that we are sending a single quote (‚Äò) as both the email and password. What error is generated from this request? <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SQLITE_ERROR</code></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What field do we have to modify in order to submit a zero-star review? <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rating</code></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h1 id="task-9---help--theres-an-intruder-">[Task 9] - Help ! There‚Äôs an Intruder !</h1>

<p><img src="/assets/img/thm/burp-suite/task-9.png" alt="Task 9" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Which attack type allows us to select multiple payload sets (one per position) and iterate through them simultaneously? <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Pitchfork</code></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How about the attack type which allows us to use one payload set in every single position we‚Äôve selected simultaneously? <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Battering Ram</code></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Which attack type allows us to select multiple payload sets (one per position) and iterate through all possible combinations? <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Cluster Bomb</code></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps the most commonly used, which attack type allows us to cycle through our payload set, putting the next available payload in each position in turn? <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Sniper</code></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, click ‚ÄòStart attack‚Äô. What is the first payload that returns a 200 status code, showing that we have successfully bypassed authentication? <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">a' or 1=1--</code></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h1 id="task-10---as-it-turns-out-the-machines-are-better-at-math-than-us">[Task 10] - As it turns out the machines are better at math than us</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>Burp‚Äôs Sequencer, per the Burp documentation, is a tool for analyzing the quality of randomness in an application‚Äôs sessions tokens and other important data items that are otherwise intended to be unpredictable. Some commonly analyzed items include:</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>Session tokens</li>
  <li>Anti-CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) tokens</li>
  <li>
    <p>Password reset tokens (sent with password resets that in theory uniquely tie users with their password reset requests)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Parse through the results. What is the effective estimated entropy measured in? <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bits</code></p>
  </li>
  <li>In order to find the usable bits of entropy we often have to make some adjustments to have a normalized dataset. What item is converted in this process? <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">token</code></li>
</ul>

<h1 id="task-11---decoder-and-comparer">[Task 11] - Decoder and Comparer</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>Decoder and Comparer, while lesser tools within Burp Suite, are still essential to understand and leverage as part of being a proficient web app tester.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>As the name suggests, Decoder is a tool that allows us to perform various transforms on pieces of data. These transforms vary from decoding/encoding to various bases or URL encoding. We chain these transforms together and Decoder will automatically spawn an additional tier each time we select a decoder, encoder, or hash. This tool ultimately functions very similarly to CyberChef, albeit slightly less powerful.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>What character does the %20 in the request we copied into Decoder decode as? <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Space</code></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Similar to CyberChef, Decoder also has a ‚ÄòMagic‚Äô mode where it will automatically attempt to decode the input it is provided. What is this mode called? <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Smart Decode</code></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What can we load into Comparer to see differences in what various user roles can access? This is very useful to check for access control issues. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">site maps</code></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Comparer can perform a diff against two different metrics, which one allows us to examine the data loaded in as-is rather than breaking it down into bytes? <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">words</code></p>
  </li>
</ul>
