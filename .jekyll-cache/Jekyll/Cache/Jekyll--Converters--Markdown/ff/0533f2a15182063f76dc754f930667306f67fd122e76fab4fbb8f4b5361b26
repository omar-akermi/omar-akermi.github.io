<h1 id="task-1---intro">[Task 1] - Intro</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>Metasploit, an open-source pentesting framework, is a powerful tool utilized by security engineers around the world. Maintained by Rapid 7, Metasploit is a collection of not only thoroughly tested exploits but also auxiliary and post-exploitation tools. Throughout this room, we will explore the basics of using this massive framework and a few of the modules it includes.</p>

<h1 id="task-2---initializing">[Task 2] - Initializing</h1>

<p>We initialize  the database with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">msfdb init</code>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Before starting Metasploit, we can view some of the advanced options we can trigger for starting the console. Check these out now by using the command: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">msfconsole -h</code></p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>We can start the Metasploit console on the command line without showing the banner or any startup information as well. What switch do we add to msfconsole to start it without showing this information? <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-q</code></li>
</ul>

<p>We start <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Metsploit</code> via the command <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">msfconsole</code>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Cool! Weâ€™ve connected to the database, which type of database does Metasploit 5 use?<br />
We used the command : <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">db_status</code>and found the type of database used by Metasploit 5 <strong>postgresql</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="task-3---rockem-to-the-core">[Task 3] - Rockâ€™em to the Core</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>Using the help menu, letâ€™s now learn the base commands and the module categories in Metasploit. Nearly all of the answers to the following questions can be found in the Metasploit help menu.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The help menu has a very short one-character alias, what is it? <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">?</code></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finding various modules we have at our disposal within Metasploit is one of the most common commands we will leverage in the framework. What is the base command we use for searching? <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">search</code></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once weâ€™ve found the module we want to leverage, what command we use to select it as the active module? <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">use</code></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How about if we want to view information about either a specific module or just the active one we have selected? <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">info</code></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Metasploit has a built-in netcat-like function where we can make a quick connection with a host simply to verify that we can â€˜talkâ€™ to it. What command is this? <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">connect</code></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Entirely one of the commands purely utilized for fun, what command displays the motd/ascii art we see when we start msfconsole (without -q flag)? <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">banner</code></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Weâ€™ll revisit these next two commands shortly, however, theyâ€™re two of the most used commands within Metasploit. First, what command do we use to change the value of a variable? <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">set</code></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Metasploit supports the use of global variables, something which is incredibly useful when youâ€™re specifically focusing on a single box. What command changes the value of a variable globally? <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">setg</code></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now that weâ€™ve learned about to change the value of variables, how do we view them? There are technically several answers to this question, however, Iâ€™m looking for a specific three-letter command which is used to view the value of single variables. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">get</code></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How about changing the value of a variable to null/no value? <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">unset</code></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When performing a penetration test itâ€™s quite common to record your screen either for further review or for providing evidence of any actions taken. This is often coupled with the collection of console output to a file as it can be incredibly useful to grep for different pieces of information output to the screen. What command can we use to set our console output to save to a file? <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">spool</code></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Leaving a Metasploit console running isnâ€™t always convenient and it can be helpful to have all of our previously set values load when starting up Metasploit. What command can we use to store the settings/active datastores from Metasploit to a settings file? This will save within your msf4 (or msf5) directory and can be undone easily by simply removing the created settings file. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">save</code></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h1 id="task-4---module-for-every-occasion">[Task 4] - Module for every Occasion!</h1>

<p><img src="/assets/img/thm/metasploit/task-4.png" alt="Task 4" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Easily the most common module utilized, which module holds all of the exploit code we will use? <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">exploit</code></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Used hand in hand with exploits, which module contains the various bits of shellcode we send to have executed following exploitation? <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">payload</code></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Which module is most commonly used in scanning and verification machines are exploitable? This is not the same as the actual exploitation of course. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">auxiliary</code></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the most common activities after exploitation is looting and pivoting. Which module provides these capabilities? <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">post</code></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Commonly utilized in payload obfuscation, which module allows us to modify the â€˜appearanceâ€™ of our exploit such that we may avoid signature detection? <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">encoder</code></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Last but not least, which module is used with buffer overflow and ROP attacks? <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NOP</code></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not every module is loaded in by default, what command can we use to load different modules? <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">load</code></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h1 id="task-5---move-that-shell">[Task 5] - Move that shell!</h1>

<p><img src="/assets/img/thm/metasploit/task-5.png" alt="Task 5" /></p>

<p>We use the command <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">db_nmap -sV BOX-IP</code>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>What service does nmap identify running on port 135? <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">msrpc</code></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now that weâ€™ve scanned our victim system, letâ€™s try connecting to it with a Metasploit payload. First, weâ€™ll have to search for the target payload. In Metasploit 5 (the most recent version at the time of writing) you can simply type â€˜useâ€™ followed by a unique string found within only the target exploit. For example, try this out now with the following command â€˜use icecastâ€™. What is the full path for our exploit that now appears on the msfconsole prompt? <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">exploit/windows/http/icecast_header</code></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While that use command with the unique string can be incredibly useful thatâ€™s not quite the exploit we want here. Letâ€™s now run the command â€˜search multi/handlerâ€™. What is the name of the column on the far left side of the console that shows up next to â€˜Nameâ€™? Go ahead and run the command <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">use NUMBER_NEXT_TO exploit/multi/handler</code> wherein the number will be what appears in that far left column (typically this will be 4 or 5). In this way, we can use our search results without typing out the full name/path of the module we want to use. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#</code></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h1 id="task-6---were-in-now-what">[Task 6] - Weâ€™re in, now what?</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>Now that weâ€™ve got a shell into our victim machine, letâ€™s take a look at several post-exploitation modules actions we can leverage! Most of the questions in the following section can be answered by using the Meterpreter help menu which can be accessed through the â€˜helpâ€™ command. This menu dynamically expands as we load more modules.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>First things first, our initial shell/process typically isnâ€™t very stable. Letâ€™s go ahead and attempt to move to a different process. First, letâ€™s list the processes using the command â€˜psâ€™. Whatâ€™s the name of the spool service? <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">spoolsv.exe</code></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Letâ€™s go ahead and move into the spool process or at least attempt to! What command do we use to transfer ourselves into the process? This wonâ€™t work at the current time as we donâ€™t have sufficient privileges but we can still try! <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">migrate</code></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Well that migration didnâ€™t work, letâ€™s find out some more information about the system so we can try to elevate. What command can we run to find out more information regarding the current user running the process we are in? <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">getuid</code></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How about finding more information out about the system itself? <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sysinfo</code></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This might take a little bit of googling, what do we run to load mimikatz (more specifically the new version of mimikatz) so we can use it? <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">load kiwi</code></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Letâ€™s go ahead and figure out the privileges of our current user, what command do we run? <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">getprivs</code></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What command do we run to transfer files to our victim computer? <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">upload</code></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How about if we want to run a Metasploit module? <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">run</code></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A simple question but still quite necessary, what command do we run to figure out the networking information and interfaces on our victim? <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ipconfig</code></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One quick extra question, what command can we run in our meterpreter session to spawn a normal system shell? <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">shell</code></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h1 id="task-7---makin-cisco-proud">[Task 7] - Makinâ€™ Cisco Proud</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>Last but certainly not least, letâ€™s take a look at the autorouting options available to us in Metasploit. While our victim machine may not have multiple network interfaces (NICs), weâ€™ll walk through the motions of pivoting through our victim as if it did have access to extra networks.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Letâ€™s go ahead and run the command <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">run autoroute -h</code>, this will pull up the help menu for autoroute. What command do we run to add a route to the following subnet: 172.18.1.0/24? Use the -n flag in your answer. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">run autoroute -s 172.18.1.0 -n 255.255.255.0</code></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Additionally, we can start a socks4a proxy server out of this session. Background our current meterpreter session and run the command <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">search server/socks4a</code>. What is the full path to the socks4a auxiliary module? <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">auxiliary/server/soks4a</code></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once weâ€™ve started a socks server we can modify our /etc/proxychains.conf file to include our new server. What command do we prefix our commands (outside of Metasploit) to run them through our socks4a server with proxychains? <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">proxychains</code></p>
  </li>
</ul>
